export const aboutYou = "As a photographer, my weekends are often filled with adventures and exploring new locations to capture beautiful images. Whether I'm home or wandering through the city, my camera is always by my side, ready to capture the world around me. In addition to my love of photography, I also enjoy cooking and creating delicious meals for my family and friends. On Sundays, I like to relax and unwind by practicing my guitar and singing, always striving to improve my musical skills. These hobbies bring me joy and help me to recharge after a busy week of shooting and editing."
